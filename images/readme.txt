PLACEHOLDER FOR IMAGES

This directory should contain the following image files:

2. app-showcase.png - A phone mockup showing the app in use
3. screenshot-1.png - Home screen screenshot
4. screenshot-2.png - Video player screenshot

Until real screenshots are available, you can use placeholder images or generate 
example images with tools like Photoshop or online mockup generators.
